The app is only distributed through the official iOS AppStore. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there are questions regarding the app or the usage of personal information.

### Information about the app and usage of user data

This app 'Pocket-Explorer' does not track itself any user data, it does not use any tracking tools. The core functionality of the app 'Pocket-Explorer' is to give user the possibility to browse and display a list and some details of requested GitHub repositories from the official public GitHub API (https://api.github.com) with a few clicks. Because the GitHub API is requested please also note the GitHub Privac policies: https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement

User can connect optionally their GitHub account. By this they gave the GitHub application I create on GitHub for this named 'Git-Explorer-App' the following permissions:

- Access public repositories
- Read all user profile data

The main purpose for the functionality to connect this GitHub app is that by this the client is authenticated and have more GitHub API requests available because GitHub provides more API requests to authenticated clients.

This permissions will also be listed by the GitHub page opened in the browser when user open it from the 'Pocket-Explorer' app when they connect the app with GitHub.

If successful connected, the GitHub API is requested with a token the app gets from GitHub. This token is saved locally on the device disk in the so called UserDefaults.

Some personal information about the user is requested from the official GitHub API and displayed on the user info page after user connects app with GitHub. The displayed user data (username, image, etc) is not saved locally on the disk or somehow communicated outside the app by the app. The app also links to the GitHub page where the user can see the given permission and also revoke the given permissions.
